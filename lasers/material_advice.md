### MDF

Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF) typically cuts quite well on the lasers with one notable exception. The easiest source is Bunnings.

Considerations:
* **Material variations**: Melamine coated MDF cuts well on the laser.
* **Moisture content**: MDF is extremely susceptible to moisture in the air and this will drastically reduce cut speeds and structural stability. Smaller pieces of MDF may be dried in the Artifactory's dry oven.
* **Cleanup**: Surface discolouration surrounding cuts/engraves are more common when using Middle Red (less air) but can also be present on Big Red during slower cuts and engraves. It can sometimes be cleaned using Isopropyl Alcohol. Alternatively you may have success sanding the surface of the material (this may negatively impact the surface of the MDF unless relatively significant effort is put into sanding). A lot of this surface discolouration can also be offset by covering the material in masking tape or other contact adhesive backed protecting covering before cutting.
  * Melamine coated MDF should be cleaned with Isopropyl Alcohol rather than being sanded.
* **Painting**: The same properties that affect MDF's sensitivity to moisture also affect the material when painting. It's common to need more paint than other materials. This can be offset by sealing your pieces after cutting.
* **Cut edge properties**: The burnt edge of MDF will not take paint well and has a distinctive finish. Light sanding can fix this but the difficulty is directly related to the complexity of the piece.

### Plywood

Plywood is made up of multiple layers of offset wood glued together. This has some advantages and disadvantages. The easiest source is Bunnings.

Considerations:
* **Material variations**: Marine grade plywood (and other fire resistant variations) do not cut well on the lasers and should be avoided. If this material is absolutely required you may have some success using the CNC router instead. You could also cut templates out of another material and use a plunge router depending on your required design.
* **Engraving finish**: Plywood will show wood grain when engraved.
* **Cleanup**: Surface discolouration surrounding cuts/engraves are more common when using Middle Red (less air) but can also be present on Big Red during slower cuts and engraves. It can sometimes be cleaned using Isopropyl Alcohol. Alternatively you may have success sanding the surface of the material (if you are not careful you will sand through the first layer of wood. This will drastically reduce the quality of your material finish in a way that is impractical to recover from.). A lot of this surface discolouration can also be offset by covering the material in masking tape or other contact adhesive backed protecting covering before cutting.
* **Painting**: Plywood paints and seals well.
* **Cut edge properties**: The burnt edge of plywood will not take paint well and has a distinctive finish. Light sanding can fix this but the difficulty is directly related to the complexity of the piece. Additionally unless covered in some way (paint/veneer etc) it will always be easily distinguished as plywood.
