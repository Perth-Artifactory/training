Checklists for operating the lasers

### Big Red

* **Turn the laser on at the wall**
  * **Check that the water chiller turned on**. It's the white box to the left of the laser cutter. You can tell that it's on because the green light will be on. Don't worry about the temperature just yet.
  * **Check that the extraction system turned on**. Big red uses a large air extractor that is connected to the back of the machine. Fumes are pulled out of the machine through slots located inside the cutting bay behind the bed. Put your hand over these slots and check for slight air movement.
* **Set your job up in LaserCut**.
* **Place your material on the bed**
  * **Make sure that your material will fit under the head**. Because Big Red's bed can move up and down it's possible for the bed to be raised to a point where your material will not fit. To lower the bed press the Z button to switch into vertical mode and use the down arrow. To exit vertical mode press the Z button again.
  * **Square your material**. The bed itself is free to slide around and cannot be relied upon to be square. The only horizontal squared surface is the gantry. (The bar that the laser head moves left and right on)
  * **If engraving ensure enough space has been left on either side of your job**. To ensure consistant engraves Big Red adds speed up/slow down buffers on each side. Unfortunately it does not take this buffer into account when determining whether your job will fit. To account for this make sure that there is at least a 5cm gap between your engrave and the edge of the bed on the horizontal axis. Don't worry, the laser isn't firing during the buffer space.
